# Tetris

A port of the 1984 tile-matching game

## Description

Tetris is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.

In Tetris, players must complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled.


In this App:

WHEN the user starts the app

THEN a tetris block (tetromino) is displayed at the top of the screen.

WHEN the user presses the left or right keys

THEN the tetromino moves in the corresponding direction.

WHEN the user presses the up key

THEN the tetromino rotates clockwise 90 degrees on its center.

WHEN the user presses the down key

THEN the tetromino's fall speed is accelerated.

WHEN the tetromino reaches the bottom of the grid or vertically touches a frozen tetromino block

THEN the tetromino freezes in place and a new active tetromino displays at the top of the screen.

WHEN fils a row with tetrominos

THEN the line of tetrominoes is cleared and all frozen tetrominoes above fall to occupy the cleared line and the score is increased.

WHEN at least one column exceeds it's capacity

THEN the game ends


## Future Developments

Improve the user interface of the web app.

Add music to the app.

Permit hard drop of tetrominoes.
